## Naming
- Use PascalCase for React components and screens
- Use camelCase for functions, variables, and hooks
- Prefix React hooks with `use`
- IPC channel names follow `domain:action` (e.g., `system-info:get`)

## Styling
- Prefer Tailwind utility classes; extract reusable patterns into components when verbose
- Keep custom CSS in `src/renderer/index.css` only when Tailwind cannot cover the case

## TypeScript
- Export types from `src/types`
- Co-locate service-specific types next to the service and re-export via `src/types/index.ts` when shared
- Treat all IPC boundaries as async and strongly typed

## React
- Screens live in `src/screens`, composed from `src/components`
- Use functional components with hooks, avoid legacy lifecycles
- Centralize side effects inside hooks or service helpers

## Files & Imports
- Use configured path aliases instead of relative `../../../`
- Keep each file under 200 lines where practical

## Testing & Tooling
- Run `npm run lint` before commits
- Run `npm run typecheck` for CI readiness
